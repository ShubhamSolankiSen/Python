# Tuples in python 
# A tuppple is an immutable data in python

# a = () --> Empty tuple
# a = (1)  --> Tuple with only onwe element needs a comma 
# a = (2)  -->  Tuple with more than one element 

# Tuple methods

# differ in tuple and list

# i can change the value of list but i cannot change the value of tuple.

# for ex.

t = (1,4,1,1,5,6)

# printing the elements of tuple
# t = () its an empty tuple
# t = (3)
# print(t)
# print(t[0])

# cannot update the values of tuple

# t[0]= 76


# tuple methods
# print(t.count(1))

print (t.index(5))
